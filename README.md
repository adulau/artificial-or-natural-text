# Artificial Or Natural Text (AONT)

Artificial Or Natural Text (AONT) is an experiment to provide a score to detect if a text is artificial or natural.

## Problem statement

Collecting a set of items from random sources. You don't know if those items are in a natural language, synthetic language (e.g. configuration files, programming language) or mixed.
The resources to do the processing are limited and using a pre-learning phase is too time consuming.
